<p>
1945 was the first game made by finn mortensen to be publicized.<br>
This was the game that started an entire 'company' and this website.
</p>

<p>
1945 began when Finn Mortensen, the creater of Nova games, got an assignment from his teacher Miss Scott.
</p>
<p>
The assignment was to create a game, where the player controlled a plane, and had to destroy enemy planes to get points.
</p>
<p>
Finn created the game and promptly named it <a href="1945.html" target="_blank">1945</a>. However, thinking it best the game doesn't throw you straight into a fight. <br>
He put a fake company on the start up menu as a joke.<br>
This was the start of a short line of games, created by Finn.
</p>

<p><br><br>
There is a cheat code built into this game, which grants the player invulnerability. This code was made to ressemble the konami code.<br>
