<h1>Temptation</h1>

<p>
Temptation was a game started in Finn's free time, however it soon became his newest assignment.<br>
The game is centered around the idea of temptation. infront of you sits a big red button. What does it do? Should I push it?<br>
no one told me not too.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple endings to this game, as marked out by polaroids stuck to your wall when you complete one.<br>
The easiest ending to get is the the assasin ending.<br>
To get this ending, you push the button and then flip the new switch before pushing the button again.
</p>

<p>
There are three other endings out there, but I'll leave them for you to discover. If you need any help, you can consult the <a href="https://discord.gg/Shfu5BJ" target="_blank">discord</a>.<br>
Just know there are more tools then there first seems.
